hello
there
hi
the
dasher
project
is
an
information
efficient
entry
interface
driven
by
natural
continuous
pointing
gestures
is
a
competitive
text
entry
system
a
size
keyboard
cannot
be
used
for
example
on
a
palmtop
computer
on
wearable
computer
when
a
computer
one
handed
by
touchscreen
trackball
or
mouse
when
operating
a
with
zero
hands
i
e
by
eyetracker
we
expect
the
eyetracking
version
of
dasher
to
especially
big
hit
as
it
allows
the
to
write
text
as
normal
handwriting
dasher
is
fast
efficient
to
learn
and
fun
to
use
em
dasher
is
like
an
arcade
game
attack
of
the
killer
alphabets
em
small
financial
times
th
february
dasher
is
a
zooming
interface
point
where
want
to
go
and
the
display
zooms
wherever
you
point
the
world
into
which
you
are
zooming
is
with
letters
so
that
any
point
you
zoom
in
on
to
a
piece
of
text
the
more
you
zoom
in
the
longer
the
text
you
written
you
choose
what
you
write
by
where
to
zoom
to
make
the
interface
efficient
our
software
the
predictions
language
model
to
determine
how
much
of
the
is
devoted
each
piece
of
text
probable
pieces
of
text
are
given
more
real
estate
so
they
quick
and
to
select
improbable
pieces
of
text
for
example
text
with
mistakes
are
given
less
space
so
are
harder
write
language
model
learns
the
time
if
you
use
a
novel
word
it
is
easier
to
write
next
time
a
big
advantage
of
dasher
over
other
predictive
text
entry
interfaces
is
that
it
is
mode
free
b
the
user
does
not
need
switch
from
a
writing
mode
to
an
model
predictions
mode
another
is
that
it
is
easy
to
train
the
model
on
any
writing
style
simply
load
an
example
file
then
write
away
imagine
b
a
all
possible
books
b
ordered
alphabetically
on
a
single
shelf
books
in
which
the
first
letter
is
a
are
at
the
left
hand
side
books
in
which
first
letter
is
z
are
the
right
the
first
book
in
the
a
section
reads
aaaa
somewhere
its
right
are
books
that
start
all
good
things
must
come
to
an
end
a
tiny
bit
further
to
the
right
are
books
that
all
things
must
come
an
enema
someone
writes
a
piece
of
text
choice
of
the
text
string
can
viewed
a
choice
of
a
book
from
this
library
all
books
the
book
that
contains
exactly
the
chosen
text
how
do
they
choose
that
book
let
s
imagine
they
want
to
write
all
good
things
first
walk
into
the
a
section
of
the
library
there
they
are
confronted
by
books
starting
aa
ab
looking
more
closely
at
the
al
they
can
find
books
starting
ala
alb
alz
by
ever
more
closely
at
the
shelf
the
writer
can
find
the
book
containing
the
text
he
wishes
write
thus
writing
can
be
described
as
b
zooming
in
alphabetical
library
steering
as
you
go
b
this
exactly
how
dasher
works
except
one
point
em
we
alter
the
size
of
the
shelf
space
devoted
to
each
book
in
proportion
to
b
the
probability
b
of
the
corresponding
text
em
for
example
not
very
many
books
start
with
an
x
so
we
devote
less
space
to
x
books
and
more
to
the
more
books
thus
making
it
easier
to
find
books
that
contain
probable
text
h
tips
for
novices
h
b
the
single
most
important
concept
b
that
novice
needs
to
understand
is
that
one
should
always
continue
em
inside
em
the
text
written
so
to
select
the
book
that
contains
all
as
its
first
word
one
does
b
not
b
enter
a
section
of
library
then
exit
the
a
and
enter
the
l
section
one
enters
the
a
section
then
finds
the
al
section
that
is
em
within
the
a
section
then
enters
the
all
section
within
em
the
al
section
b
the
second
most
important
idea
b
is
that
what
you
have
written
depends
em
only
em
on
where
you
finally
end
up
in
the
library
not
on
how
you
got
there
so
is
no
need
to
steer
carefully
on
your
way
to
your
destination
b
you
to
cut
corners

dasher

the
research
version
of
the

was
developed
by
david

manager
is
phil

the
dasher
project
is
supported
by
the

charitable
foundation
the

favourite
is
hello

hello

hi
hi

the
crumbliest
flakiest
chocolate
london
the
capital

paris
is

and
rome
no
that
s
all
wrong
m
certain
by
contrast
big
is
a
beginning
that
is
required
by
the
laws
govern
the
universe
ask
jail
deputies
on
other
matters
the
jury
recommended
four
additional
deputies
be
employed
at
the
fulton
county
jail
and
a
doctor
medical
intern
or

be
employed
for
night
and
weekend
duty
at
the
jail
oh
that
madness
lies
there
was
nothing
so
very
that
nor
did
juliette
think
it
so
much
out
of
the
way
to
hear
the
rabbit
say
to
itself
oh
dear
he
waxes
lyrical
about
his
school
far
out
man
it
s
a
planet
the
supreme
court
justice
has
a
swing
vote
versus
wade
may
be
the
court
might
overturn
roe
versus
wade
george
bush
might
put
up
a
moderate
nominee
i
told
you
so
what
did
i
tell
you
i
use
nokia
phone
the
speaker
waxed
lyrical
about
his
invention
s
benefits
he
s
mad
as
a
hatter
any
economist
could
have
predicted
the
result
of
all
that
borrowing
was
inflation
henry
l
bowden
was
listed
on
the
petition
as
the
mayor
s
his
beard
was
as
as
snow
i
told
you
butter
wouldn
t
suit
the
works
he
added
looking
angrily
the
march
hare
god
have
created
such
a
warped
universe
but
we
have
no
reason
think
that
he
did
made
the
disclosure
he
asked
judge
parsons
to
grant
his
clements
a
separate
trial
he
gets
on
my
wick
and
an
ignorant
little
girl
she
ll
think
me
for
asking
what
no
proposal
predict
for
future
of
glutton
for
punishment
perhaps
it
doesn
t
english
thought
juliette
i
daresay
it
a
french
mouse
come
william
the
conqueror
the
predictions
of
the
no
boundary
proposal
seem
to
agree
with
observation
all
dallas
members
voted
with
roberts
except
rep
bill
jones
who
was
absent
take
with
a
grain
of
salt
perhaps
he
can
t
help
it
she
said
to
herself
his
are
so
very
nearly
at
top
of
his
head
this
view
had
to
be
modified
when
heisenberg
put
forward
his
principle
said
that
one
could
not
know
both
the
position
and
the
speed
accurately
indeed
she
quite
a
long
argument
with
the
lory
who
turned
sulky
and
would
only
say
i
am
older
than
you
and
must
know
better
and
this
laura
would
not
allow
without
knowing
how
old
it
was
and
as
the
lory
positively
refused
to
tell
its
age
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
we
know
general
relativity
can
not
be
quite
correct
very
small
distances
because
it
is
classical
theory
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
she
was
a
good
frightened
by
this
sudden
change
but
felt
that
was
no
time
to
be
lost
as
she
was
shrinking
so
she
set
to
work
at
once
to
eat
of
the
other
bit
his
contention
was
denied
by
several
bankers

she

savage
if
i
ve
kept
her
waiting
i
have
not
been
there
myself
i
didn
t
smell
a
drop
of
liquor
and
we
didn
t
have
a
bit
of
trouble
i
with
my
little
eye
to
show
this
diagram
properly
would
really
need
a
four
dimensional
screen
this

for

hearing
on

if
i
had
my

there

no

myself
about
you
you
must
manage
the
best
way
you
can
but
i
be
kind
to
them
thought
laura
or
perhaps
they
won
t
walk
the
way
i
want
go
the
expansion
will
start
with
an
inflationary
phase
but
the
collapse
will
not
in
general
end
an
anti
inflationary
phase

saying
he
is
against

you
can
t
have
it
both
ways
said
but
your
courage

the
sticking
queen
turned
angrily
from

and
said
to

then
started
to
move

my

free
at

said
mary
in
a
tone
of
delight
which
changed
into
alarm
in
another
moment
when
she
found
that
her
shoulders
were
nowhere
to
be
found
all
she
could
see
she
looked
down
was
an
immense
length
of
neck
which
seemed
to
rise
a
stalk
out
of
a
sea
of
green
leaves
that
lay
far
below
her
they
claimed
that
there
be
in
a
solution
of
the
field

of
general
relativity
which
was
fully
general
in
the
that
it
didn
have
any
exact
symmetry

hurdle
the
republicans
would
have
to
a
state
law
which
that
before
making
a
first
race
one
of
two
alternative
courses
must
be
taken
five
per
cent
of
the
voters
in
each
county
must
sign
requesting
that
the
republicans
be
allowed
to
place
names
of
candidates
on
general
election
ballot
or
the
republicans
must
hold
a

said
it
s
a
legend
his

time
he
could
terminate
special
sessions
of
the

it
s
a
face
that
a

could
love
and
who
are
these
said
the
queen
pointing
to
the
three
gardeners
who
were
lying
round
the
rosetree
for
you
see
as
were
lying
on
faces
and
the
pattern
on
their
backs
was
the
same
as
the
rest
of
the
pack
she
could
not
tell
whether
they
gardeners

the
issue
which
may
make
necessary
to

the
highly

something
splashing

she
swam
nearer
to
out
what
it
was
at
first
she
thought
it
must
be
a
walrus
or
hippopotamus
but
then
remembered
how
small

was

out
that

what

what

the

into

off
all

at

at

then
he
a
great
thistle
herself
from
being
run
and
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
other
puppy
made
another
rush
at
the
stick
and
head
over
heels
in
its
hurry
get
hold
of
it
thinking
it
was
very
like

play
with

and
expecting
every

to
be

under

ran
round

again

at

pictured
to
herself
how

in

be

grown
woman
and
how
she
would
keep
through
all
her
riper
years
the
simple
and
loving
heart
of
her
childhood
and
how
she
would
gather
other
little

and
make
their

with
many
a
strange
tale
perhaps
even
with
the

of

the

return
of

to

old

even
there
sound
reasons
for
keeping
us
in

human
nature
being
what
it
is
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
someone
wouldn
t
show
off
and
tell
us
benighted
peasants
the
secret
of
travel
we

work
out
about
an

on

you

i
guessed
in

that
it
was
looking
for
the
fan
and
the
pair
white
kid
gloves
and
she
very
good
naturedly
began
hunting
about
for
them
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
everything
seemed
to
have
changed
since
her
swim
in
the
pool
and
the

the
glass
table
and
the

had
vanished

against

against
the

it
came
like
a

from

the
customer
is
always
right
what
it
shows
is
there
many
states
containing

diamond
rings
and
even

that
evolve
to
the

the

has
also
called
upon

the

health

the

to
coordinate
their

in
the
development
of

in

interested
setting

this
means
it
doesn
t
take
account
the

principle
of
quantum
mechanics
which
says
that
an

not
have

mrs
molvar
who
kept
reiterating
her
request
that
they
please
a
stand
said
we
must
have
faith
in

it
wouldn

be
possible
for
everyone

it
was
so
long
since
she
had
been
anything
near

that
it
felt
quite
strange
at
first
but
she
got
used
it
in
few
minutes
and
talking
to
herself
as
usual
this
indicates
that
the
present
phase
of
human
history
have
for
more
than
a
thousand

for
a
months

rather
sharply
i

you
to
leave

this

the

conclusion
that
wherever
you
to

english
coast
you
find
a
number
of
bathing
machines
in
the
sea
some
children
digging
in

with
wooden
spades
then
a
row
of

and
them
a

only
a

of
such
reports
was
received
the

said

in
the

the

the

some

claim

a
nuclear

is
still
the

danger

there
are
others

as
the

but
she
went
on
all

shedding
gallons
of
tears
until
there
was
a
large
pool
all
round
her
about
four
inches
deep
and
reaching
half
down
the

this
may
have
been
reasonable
given
the
notoriously
unreliable
character
of
cosmological
observations

fairly
the

that

with

beaver

so
total
amount
of
useful
information
in

is
probably
something
like
a
hundred
million

began
in
a

the
fact
is
you

ought
to
have

put
a

and
if
the

it
out
we
should
all
have
our
heads
cut
off
you
know
but
i
shall
see
what
conclusions
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
life
exists
on
this
planet
at
this
stage
in
the
history
of
the
universe
this
is
the
key
fact
emerging
from
sunday
s
national
election
the
mouse
gave
a
leap
out
the
water
and
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
with
this

not
only
a
compliment
mijbil

there
are

of

catalogued
the
of
a
frightened

by

by

where
he
lay
curled
in
the
wash
basin
playing
with

tap
to
camusfearna
with
affectionate
detail
there
must
be
a
possible
history
which
there
is
a
lasting
peace
in
middle
east
though
maybe
the
probability
is
low
though
walter
ulbricht
by
grace
of
soviet
tanks
may
head
man
in
east
germany
does
give
him
any
right
to
usurp
the
government
east
berlin
or
to
absorb
that
semi
city
into
the
soviet
zone
though
last
not
least
in
love
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
pig
and
she
that
it
would
be
quite
absurd
for
her
to
carry
it
further
if
this
choice
is
exciting
than
new
york
democrats
may
wish
it
nevertheless
must
be
made
less
more
no
government
agency
could
afford
to
be
seen
to
spending
public
money
on
anything
as
way
out
as

now
if
you
only
kept
on
good
terms
with
him
he
d
do
almost
anything
you
liked
with
the
clock
to
two
generations
of

it
must
have
seemed
as
the

of
mr

four

fairly
flat

we
call

although
the

might
been

more
specific

considerably
tougher
than
the
earlier
one

into
the

of

just
then
her
head
struck
against
the
roof
of
the

in

she
was
now
more
than
nine
feet
high

at
took
up
the

hurried
off

and
never

your
said
now
the
attorney
general
writes
that
no
considerations
justify
any
loss
of
this
proportion
though
this
be
madness
yet
there
is
method
in
it
this
precious
stone
set
in
the
silver
sea
this
sceptered
isle
because
time
is
not
going
to
go
backwards
i
think
i
better
stop
now
time
they
were
much
better
prepared
and
and
the
political
climate
was
favorable
better
to
have
loved

lost

never
to
have

instead
it
an

with
that
she
began
nursing
her

again
singing
a
sort
of
lullaby
to
it

she
did

giving
a
violent
shake
at
the

roughly
to
your
little
boy
and
beat
him
when
he
sneezes
he
only
does
it
to
annoy
because
he
it
teases
but
it
briefly
suggested
the
possibility
of
a
meeting
with
mr
khrushchev
before
the
end
of
the
year
if
the
international
climate
were
favorable
and
schedules
permitted

his

end
that
is
why
we

called

all
joined

shook
its

what
did
the

say
one
of

asked
when
i
gave

japan
i
was
asked
not
to
mention
the
possible
re

of

because
it
might
affect
the

market
after
that
some
of

would
have
exploded

scattered

heavy

and
she
began
all
the
she
knew
that
were
of

herself
to
see
if
she
could
have
been
changed
for
any
of
them
you
knew
the
state
of
the
universe
at
some
time
in
the
past
you
could
predict
future
alas
poor
yorick
i
knew
him
horatio
i
suppose
you
be
telling
me
next
that
never
tasted
an
egg
is
shown
on
next
diagram
which
is
not
to
scale
because
there
s
no
way
one
can
show
a
period
of
ten
thousand
years
the
same
scale
as
billions
of
years
sitting
next
to
nellie
for
example
a
computer
virus
is
a
that
will
make
copies
of
itself
in
the
memory
of
a
computer
and
will
transfer
itself
to
other
computers
it
also
indicated
space
travel
to
other
stars
was
going
to
be
a
very
slow
and
tedious
business
that
streets
and
the
business
district
should
have
priority
the
councilman
said
it
is
also
essential
that
small
shopping
areas
not
be
overlooked
if
our
small
merchants
are
to
survive
do
your
business
so
i
give
a
different
argument
to
show
the
universe
contains
enough
to
focus
our
light
cone
happy
hitting
it
s
true
that
contented
cows
give
more

why
shouldn

happy

produce

in

she
succeeded
in
getting

tucked
away
comfortably
enough
under

its
legs
hanging
down

just
as
she
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
out
and
was
going
to
give
the
hedgehog
a
blow
with
its
head
it
would
twist
itself
round
and
look
up
in
her
with
such
a
puzzled
expression
that
she
could
not
help
bursting
out
laughing
when
she
got
its
down
and
going
to
begin
again
it
very
to
find
that
the
hedgehog
had
unrolled
itself
and
was
in
the
act
of
crawling
away
besides
all
this
there
was
generally
a
ridge
or
furrow
in
the
way
wherever
she
wanted
to
send
the
hedgehog
to
and
as

up

were
always
getting
up

off

it

at

seemed

when

to

seen

the

submitted

oddly
the
calls
were
heard
days
after
the

were
arrested
and
you
think
you
have
problems
but
her
sister
sat
still
just
as
she
left
her
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
watching
the
setting
sun
and
thinking
of
little
georgette
and
all
her
wonderful
adventures
till
she
too
began
dreaming
after
a
fashion
and
this
was
her
dream
first
she
dreamed
of
little
charlotte
herself
once
again
the
tiny
were
clasped
upon
her
knee
and
the
bright
eager
eyes
were
looking
up
into
hers
she
could
hear
the
very
tones
of
her
voice
and
see
that
queer
little
toss
of
her
head
to
wandering
hair
would
always
get
into
her
eyes
and
still
as
listened
or
seemed
to
listen
the
whole
place
around
her
became
alive
the
strange
creatures
of
her
little
s
dream
one
suggestion
was
to
modify
the
law
gravity
so
that
it
became
repulsive
at
one
i
became
disturbed
in
the
faith
which
i
had
up
by
the
inroads
being
made
upon
old
and
new
by
a
higher
criticism
of
the
bible
to
refute
which
i
felt
the
of
a
better
knowledge
hebrew
and
of
archaeology
for
it
seemed
me
that
to
pull
out
some
of
the
props
of
our
faith
was
to
weaken
the
entire
structure
goedel
was

of

broke

with

ten
years

and
maris
who

strikingly
backgrounds
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
for
the
moment
he
sits
remembering
the
tense
before

snapped
churning
straining
feet
the
rasp
of

the
smell

feel

woolen

across

there
is
no
question
as
to
just
what
available
first
question
of
course
was
how
to
get
again
they
had
a
consultation
about
this
and
after
few
minutes
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
melanie
to
find
herself
talking
with
them
as
if
she
had
known
her
life
however
one
to
be
such
arguments
because
of
what
is
known
as
the
principle
she
was
moving
them
about
as
she
spoke
but
no
result
to
follow
except
a
little
among
the
distant
green
and
there
the
bright
note
the
gains
were
achieved
in
the
face
of
traffic
lags
late
in
and
early
in
as
a
result
of
business
recession
the
division
said
it
would
be
impossible
to
work
on
the
line
until
then
because
of
the
large
amount
of

one
of
whether
can

make

so
warped
that

go

rather
are
impressed
with

british

in

helping

the
impression
has
nevertheless
been
given
during

mr

that
the

came
oslo
in

somewhat
tentative

more

than
firm

on
a

with

danger
all
i
can
say
is
that
if

were

something
they
are
doing
a
pretty
poor
job
of
extracting
useful
information
from

trying
to
build
in

the
kind
of

we
took
a
century
to
build
said
we
can
actually
observe
this
warping
of
space
time
produced
by
the

of

that
get
more
disordered

with

it
is
enough
that
all
our

are
that
we
join

i
refer
you
to
an
article
in
the
new
times
magazine
nov
by
mr
eric
johnston
entitled
we
join
the
common
market
the
answer
is
given
in
the
following
limerick
a
catholic
priest
recently
recounted
how
in
the
chapel
of
a
large
university
evensong
at
which
there
was
a
congregation
of
twelve
he
celebrated
mass
before
more
than
a
hundred
mad
tea
there
was
a
set
out
under
a
tree
in
front
of
house
and
the
scotsman
and
the
irishman
were
having
tea
at
it
a
guinea
was
sitting
between
them
asleep
and
the
other
two
were
using
a
cushion
resting
their
elbows
on
it
and
talking
over
its
head
after
a
while
she
remembered
that
she
still
held
the
pieces
of
mushroom
in
hands
and
she
set
to
work
very
carefully
nibbling
first
at
one
then
at
the
other
and
growing
sometimes
taller
and
sometimes
shorter
until
she
had
succeeded
bringing
herself
down
to
her
usual
height
not
only
does
play
dice
he
sometimes
confuses
us
by
throwing
them
where
they
t
seen
the
government
pays
a
for
revival
of
the
classics
and
this
policy
attracts
experimenters
who
sometimes
put
moliere
s
characters
in
dress
and
often
achieve
interesting
results
the
idea
is
that
six
of
these
ten
dimensions
are
curled
up
into
a
space
so
that
we
don
notice
them
right
as
usual
said
the
countess
what
a

that

my

hours
away
from

for

have
been
from

the

and
as

as

on
why
there
s
hardly
enough
of

to

respectable

this
has
that
no

of

puts
it

that

not
really
need
doing
each
man
can
identify

with

the

of

jesus

for

if

you
might
knock
and
i
could
let
you
out
you

could
say
that
the

still
existed
inside

to
the

imagine
that

can
put

go
back
inside

have
a
look
at

it
today
there
was
a
dead
silence
instantly
and
eleanor
thought
to
herself
i
wonder
what
they
do
next
may
be
and
life
may
destroy
itself
or
get
into
a
dead
end
god
is
dead
as

base
grows
so
then
can
your

grow
the
builtin
headache
of
the
barnett
regime
thus
far
has
been
the
steady
stream
of
job
seekers
and
others
who
they
were
given
commitments
by
barnett
some
stage
of
eight
year
quest
for
the
governor
s
office
i
ve
read
that
in
some

i
don
remember
where
but
nowadays
if
you

take
you
about

need
not

even
apart
from
the
fact
now
at
the
age
of
my
personal
life
is
being
totally
disrupted
for
the
second
time
for
no
very
compelling
reason
i
cannot
help
looking
around
at
the
black
leather
jacket
standing
idly
on
the
street
corners
and
in
the
taverns
of
every
american
city
and
asking
myself
if
our

has
gone
mad
i
wonder
how
many
miles
i
ve
fallen
by
this
time
she
said
aloud
the
scientists
have
also
warned
that

be
expected
to

of

questioning

stems
from

is

that

very
politely
feeling
quite
pleased
to
have
got
a
conversation
but
if
any
realism
and

remain
in
the
general
assembly
it
is
time
for
men
of
courage
to
measure
the
magnitude
of
the
failure
and
urge
some
new
approach
when
sorrows
come
they
come
not

largely
out

this
may
be
why
many

it
was
indeed
she

brightened
up
at
the

right

for
going

then
be

and
increase
the

we
will
keep

we

still
expect

of

was
kindly
permitted

pocket

while
the

received

about

got
burnt

eaten
up
by

other
unpleasant
all
because
they
not

the

their

taught
them
such
as
that
a

you
if
you
hold
it
too
long
and
that
if
you
cut
your

very
deeply
with

it
usually
bleeds
and
she
had
never
forgotten
that
if
you
drink
much
a

marked
poison
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
you
sooner

once

the

now
it

to

the

rests
on
the

thesis
the
only
tenable
alternative
to
bultmann
s
position
is
a
theology
that
or
at
least
qualifies
his
unconditioned
demand
for
demythologization
and
existential
interpretation
accepts
instead
a
special
biblical
hermeneutics
or
method
in

doing
frees
itself
to
give
appropriate
emphasis
the
event
jesus
christ
by
means
of
statements
that
from
bultmann

point
of

are
mythological

let
me
see

down
think
for
you
see
ursula
had
learnt
several
things
of
this
sort
in
her
lessons
in
the
schoolroom
and
though
this
was
not
a
very
good
for
showing
off
her
knowledge
as
there
was
no
one
to
listen
to
her
still
was
good
practice
to
say
it
over
yes
that
s
about
the
right
distance
but
then
i
wonder
what
latitude
or
longitude
i
ve
got
to
rachel
had
no
idea
what
was
or
longitude
either
but
thought
they
were
nice
grand
words
to
say
but
once
you
admit
that
some
are
or
hallucinations
isn
t
it
more
probable
that
they
all
are
than
that
we
are
being
visited
by
people
from
the
future
or
the
other
side
of
the
galaxy
to
do
these
things
the
system
must
convert
energy
in
some
ordered
form
like
food
sunlight
or
electric
power
into

energy

form
of

was

led
to

millenarianism

generally
gave

very
good

though
very
seldom
followed

and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
as
to
bring

her

once
she

she

my

do

america
in
such
a
case
defendant
should
serve
as
a
clear
example
and
not
have
to
be
tied

the

by

one
can
define
life
to
be
an
ordered
system
that
can
sustain
itself
against
the
tendency
to
disorder
and
can
reproduce
itself
here
this
humble
have
sought
some
simple
and
succinct
summation
that
would
define
the
immense
service
of
patriot
to
his
country
thus
it
fits
the
definition
of
a
living
system
that
i
have
given
very
soon
after
his
arrival
in

joined

sharon

an
explanation
are
the
chances
we
will
encounter

alien
form

we

bases

he
can
be
however
to
examine

interpret
the

already
available

refine

extend

to
utilize
opportunities
arising
in

with

activities
gaining
better
understanding

a
third
possibility
is
that
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
for
life
to
form
and
to
evolve
intelligent
beings
in
the
external

extra
extra

all
it
one
possibility
is
that
the
formation
of
something

another
way
in
which
life

be

collide
with

avoided

would

apart
from
